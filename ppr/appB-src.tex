\chapter{Source Code}\label{app:SourceCode}
The source code developed for this thesis is available at the following GitLab repository \cite{Denis2017} (\url{https://gitlab.mech.kuleuven.be/rob-mastertheses/kdenis-2016}) and can be found in the src directory. The most important notes are available in the README in this directory. More information is given in each function if needed. The same information has been uploaded as ``Digital Appendix'', also under the src folder. 

\section{Directory Organization}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item ROOT: contains all the most important scripts and functions.
\item data\_img: contains all the used maps and robot's footprint / geometry.
\item data\_mat: contains all the precomputed data (paths and corresponding lookup tables) for fast use of the local path planner in  the ``main'' example. Also for the plot scripts.
\item helper\_external:  contains all the files which are \emph{NOT} written by Kevin DENIS, but found on the web (mostly MATLAB file exchange or stackoverflow).
\item helper\_func: contains all the sub-functions needed for the main functions from the root.
\item helper\_plot: contains all functions needed for plotting scripts.
\item scripts\_plot: contains all the scripts which were used to create  figures.
