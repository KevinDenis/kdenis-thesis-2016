  abstract = {The Overbot is one of the original DARPA Grand Challenge vehicles now being used as a platform for autonomous vehicle research. The vehicle, equipped with a complete actuator and sensor suite, provides for an extremely capable robotic platform with computing infrastructure and software framework already in place to create a reconfigurable testbed. For point to point navigation, calculating suitable paths is computationally difficult. Maneuvering the vehicle safely around obstacles is essential, and the ability to generate safe paths in a real time environment is crucial for vehicle viability. We present a method for developing feasible paths through complicated environments using a baseline smooth path based on cubic splines. A method for adjusting and bending the spline to avoid obstacles is developed. This method is able to iteratively refine the path to more directly compute a feasible path and thus find an efficient, collision free path in real time through an unstructured environment. This method, when implemented in a receding horizon fashion, becomes the basis for high level control.},

The car type vehicle can be modelled as a nonholonomic system with constraints on sideways movement. The spline based trajectory generation gives us continuous, smooth and optimized path trajectories. The motion planning algorithm is based on the nonholonomic model of a car-type robot which is differentially flat in nature. Our contribution lies in the development of spline based trajectories which overcome the parametric singularities arising from the differential flatness based approach. The spline trajectories also take care of the singularities which are otherwise observed in the optimization process if the cubic polynomial based interpolation is implemented. The hardware implementation for a prototype of a car type model is also presented. Using the concept of differential flatness, we derive control inputs which steer the vehicle along this trajectory.},

A global path planner is used to generate collision-free straight-line paths from the robot's position to a given goal location. With waypoints of this path, an initial trajectory is generated which defines the planned position of the robot over time. A velocity profile is computed that accounts for constraints on the velocity and acceleration of the robot. The trajectory is refined to minimize the time needed for traversal by an any-time optimization algorithm. An error-feedback controller generates motor commands to execute the planned trajectory. Quintic Be{\^A}\textquestiondown{}zier splines are used to allow for curvature-continuous joins of trajectory segments, which enables the system to replan trajectories in order to react to unmapped obstacles.

  abstract = {A practical approach for generating motion paths with continuous steering for car-like mobile robots is presented here. This paper addresses two key issues in robot motion planning; path continuity and maximum curvature constraint for nonholonomic robots. The advantage of this new method is that it allows robots to account for their constraints in an efficient manner that facilitates real-time planning. B-spline curves are leveraged for their robustness and practical synthesis to model the vehicle's path. Comparative navigational-based analyses are presented to selected appropriate curve and nominate its parameters. Path continuity is achieved by utilizing a single path, to represent the trajectory, with no limitations on path, or orientation. The path parameters are formulated with respect to the robot's constraints. Maximum curvature is satisfied locally, in every segment using a smoothing algorithm, if needed. It is demonstrated that any local modifications of single sections have minimal effect on the entire path. Rigorous simulations are presented, to highlight the benefits of the proposed method, in comparison to existing approaches with regards to continuity, curvature control, path length and resulting acceleration. Experimental results validate that our approach mimics human steering with high accuracy. Accordingly, efficiently formulated continuous paths ultimately contribute towards passenger comfort improvement. Using presented approach, autonomous vehicles generate and follow paths that humans are accustomed to, with minimum disturbances.},

  abstract = {The time-optimal path planning problem aims at bringing a system from an initial to terminal state in minimal time while obeying both geometric and dynamic constraints. Path planning problems are often decoupled into a high-level path planning stage where a feasible geometric path is determined and a low level stage where system dynamics are taken into account. The paper combines the geometric and dynamic approach into a single optimization problem for so-called differentially flat systems. The geometric path is represented as a convex combination of two or more feasible paths. Relying on differential flatness, the dynamics of the system are projected onto the path which leads to a single input system. The resulting optimization problem is transformed into a fixed end-time optimal control problem that can be initialized easily. An application to a wheeled mobile robot, a challenging non-linear system, will illustrate the proposed approach throughout the paper.},

  abstract = {We propose a method of generating motion primitives
for motion planning under differential constraints. These
primitives lend themselves particularly well to off-line precomputation.
In this manner, they are attractive due to their
capacity to capture the mobility constraints of the robot and to
establish a state sampling policy that is conducive to efficient
search. The first objective allows encoding mobility constraints
into primitives, thereby enabling fast unconstrained search to
produce feasible solutions. The second objective enables high
quality (lattice) sampling of state space, further speeding up
exploration during search. A number of techniques, novel
in differentially constrained planning, are enabled with this
approach, including incremental search, efficient bi-directional
search and incremental sampling.},

In such scenarios, robots must be able to maneuver in crowded spaces, partially filled with static and dynamic obstacles (such as people). Our approach produces smooth, complex maneuvers over large distances through the use of an anytime graph search algorithm applied to a novel multi-resolution state lattice, where the resolution is adapted based on both environmental characteristics and task characteristics. In addition, we present a novel approach for generating fast globally optimal trajectories in constrained spaces (i.e. rooms connected via doors and hallways). This approach exploits offline precomputation to provide extremely efficient online performance and is applicable to a wide range of both indoor and outdoor navigation scenarios. By combining an anytime, multi-resolution lattice-based search algorithm with our precomputation technique, globally optimal trajectories in up to four dimensions (2D position, heading and velocity) are obtained in real-time.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm for the solution to the problem of Hermite G1 interpolation with a clothoid curve is herein proposed, that is, a clothoid that interpolates two given points in a plane with assigned unit tangent vectors. The interpolation problem is formulated as a system of three nonlinear equations with multiple solutions, which is difficult to solve even numerically. In this work the solution of this system is reduced to the computation of the zeros of only one single nonlinear function in one variable. The location of the relevant zero is tackled analytically: it is provided the interval containing the zero where the solution is proved to exist and to be unique. A simple guess function allows to find that zero with very few iterations in all of the possible instances. Computing clothoid curves calls for evaluating Fresnel-related integrals, asymptotic expansions near critical values are herein conceived to avoid loss of precision. This is particularly important when the solution of the interpolation problem is close to a straight line or an arc of circle. The present algorithm is shown to be simple and compact. The comparison with literature algorithms proves that the present algorithm converges more quickly and accuracy is conserved in all of the possible instances, whereas other algorithms have a loss of accuracy near the transition zones.

These maneuvers require motion control skills that disabled people, in spite of their disabilities, are eager to learn and quite good at using. Instead, this work focused on generalizing the approach to fine motion control by considering those maneuvers identified as very burdensome due to their duration and required concentration. One of these functions is deliberative locomotion in rapidly changing, large-scale environments, such as shopping malls, entry halls of theaters, and concourses of airports or railway stations, where tens or hundreds of people and objects move around. MAid's performance was tested in the central station of Ulm during rush hour and in the exhibition halls of the Hannover Messe '98, the largest industrial fair in the world. Altogether, MAid has survived more than 36 h of testing in public, crowded environments with heavy passenger traffic.},

Such paths have a discontinuous curvature profile. Accordingly a vehicle following such a path has to stop at each curvature discontinuity in order to re-orientate its front wheels. To remove this limitation, we add a continuous-curvature constraint to the problem at hand. In addition, we introduce a constraint on the curvature derivative, so as to reflect the fact that a car-like vehicle can only re-orientate its front wheels with a finite velocity. We propose an efficient solution to the problem at hand that relies upon the definition of a set of paths with continuous curvature and maximum curvature derivative. These paths contain at most eight pieces, each piece being either a line segment, a circular arc of maximum curvature, or a clothoid arc. They are called simple continuous curvature paths. They are used to design a local path planner. The experimental results are presented},

  doi = {10.1002/rob.20285},
  abstract = {We present an approach to the problem of differentially constrained mobile robot motion planning in arbitrary cost fields. The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection. Experimental results with research prototype rovers demonstrate that the planner allows us to exploit the entire envelope of vehicle maneuverability in rough terrain, while featuring real-time performance. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It presents a modular and distributed software architecture, which integrates localization, mapping, collision avoidance, planning, and various modules concerned with user interaction and Web-based telepresence. At its heart, the software approach relies on probabilistic computation, on-line learning, and any-time algorithms. It enables robots to operate safely, reliably, and at high speeds in highly dynamic environments, and does not require any modifications of the environment to aid the robot's operation. Special emphasis is placed on the design of interactive capabilities that appeal to people's intuition. The interface provides new means for human-robot interaction with crowds of people in public places, and it also provides people all around the world with the ability to establish a ``virtual telepresence'' using the Web. To illustrate our approach, results are reported obtained in mid-1997, when our robot ``RHINO'' was deployed for a period of six days in a densely populated museum. The empirical results demonstrate reliable operation in public environments. The robot successfully raised the museum's attendance by more than 50\%. In addition, thousands of people all over the world controlled the robot through the Web. We conjecture that these innovations transcend to a much larger range of application domains for service robots.},

One solution to this challenge is to schedule available professionals for demanding tasks while relieving them from simpler activities which are transferred to a robotic cleaning assistant. Two of such tasks are floor cleaning and waste disposal which account for 70\% of the daily cleaning efforts. This paper presents the world's first autonomous cleaning robot prototype that masters both of these tasks and whose development was accompanied by the advice of a large cleaning company. Besides a detailed description of the overall system and its individual components an evaluation is provided based on real world experiments. The results indicate that both cleaning tasks can be solved at high quality but with potential for increased efficiency to meet the required performance. Hence, the paper concludes with a discussion on measures necessary for the development of a commercial prototype.},

At the core of our approach is a quasi-static cloth model which allows us to neglect the complex dynamics of cloth under significant parts of the state space, allowing us to reason instead in terms of simple geometry. We present an algorithm which, given a 2D cloth polygon and a desired sequence of folds, outputs a motion plan for executing the corresponding manipulations, deemed g-folds, on a minimal number of robot grippers. We define parametrized fold sequences for four clothing categories: towels, pants, short-sleeved shirts, and long-sleeved shirts, each represented as polygons. We then devise a model-based optimization approach for visually inferring the class and pose of a spread-out or folded clothing article from a single image, such that the resulting polygon provides a parse suitable for these folding primitives. We test the manipulation and perception tasks individually, and combine them to implement an autonomous folding system on the Willow Garage PR2. This enables the PR2 to identify a clothing article spread out on a table, execute the computed folding sequence, and visually track its progress over successive folds.},

This real-world warehouse                 installation required adapting a navigational paradigm designed for highly                 structured environments such as office corridors (with smooth walls and regularly                 spaced doorways) to a semistructured warehouse environment (with no exposed walls                 and within which odd-shaped objects unpredictably move about from day to day). A                 number of challenges, some expected and others unexpected, were encountered during                 the transfer of the system first to a beta-test/demonstration site and then to an                 operational warehouse.

A key lesson is that system robustness can only                 be ensured by exhaustively exercising the system's operational                 capabilities in a number of diverse environments. This approach helps to uncover                 latent system hardware deficiencies and software implementation errors not                 manifested in the initial system hardware or initial development environment, and to                 identify sensor modes or processing algorithms tuned too tightly to the specific                 characteristics of the initial development environment.},

The proposed schemes take hereto the non-holonomic nature and a detailed geometry of the wheelchair into consideration. The methods encode the environment as a set of collision-free circular paths and, making use of a model-free impedance controller, `haptically' guide the user along collision-free paths or away from obstructed paths or paths that simply do not coincide with the motion intended by the user. The haptic feedback plays a central role as it establishes a fast bilateral communication channel between user and wheelchair controller and allows a direct negotiation about wheelchair motion. If found unsatisfactory, suggested trajectories can always be overruled by the user. Relying on inputs from user modeling and intention recognition schemes, the system can reduce forces needed to move along intended directions, thereby avoiding unnecessary fatigue of the user. A commercial powered wheelchair was upgraded and feasability tests were conducted to validate the proposed methods. The potential of the proposed approaches was hereby demonstrated.},

In our approach we first extract information from users preference related to comfort while sitting on a robotic wheelchair under different conditions in an indoor corridor environment. Human-comfort factors are integrated to a geometric map generated by SLAM framework. Then a global planner computes a safe and comfortable path which is followed by the robotic wheelchair. Finally, an evaluation with 29 participants using a fully autonomous robotic wheelchair, showed that more than 90\% of them found the proposed approach more comfortable than a shortest-path state of the art approach.},

  abstract = {Safe operation of autonomous systems demands a collision-free motion trajectory at every time instant. This paper presents a method to calculate time-optimal motion trajectories for autonomous systems moving through an environment with both stationary and moving obstacles. To transform this motion planning problem into a small dimensional optimization problem, suitable for real-time optimization, the approach (i) uses a spline parameterization of the motion trajectory; and (ii) exploits spline properties to reduce the number of constraints. Solving this optimization problem with a receding horizon allows dealing with modeling errors and variations in the environment. In addition to extensive numerical simulations, the method is experimentally validated on a KUKA youBot. The average solving time of the optimization problem in the experiments is 0.05s, which is sufficiently fast for correcting deviations from the initial trajectory.},

  abstract = {This work presents an online distributed motion planning strategy for cooperating vehicles. The motion planning is formulated as an optimization problem that returns smooth trajectories. These are parameterized as splines, which allows a representation with a limited number of variables and enables guaranteed constraint satisfaction with a finite set of constraints. The computations for solving the problem are distributed among the agents by using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). In order to cope with a dynamic environment and disturbances, the algorithm is formulated in a receding horizon fashion, such that the future part of a motion trajectory is reoptimized iteratively. The required update time and the amount of inter-agent communication are reduced by performing only one ADMM iteration per update. In this way the method converges over the subsequent path updates. Simulations with a formation of holonomic vehicles in a dynamic environment demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to generate optimal trajectories at an update rate of 20 Hz.},

In this research the motion planning problem for systems that admit a polynomial description of the system dynamics through differential flatness is tackled by parameterizing the system's so-called flat output as a polynomial spline. Using basic properties of B-splines, sufficient conditions on the spline coefficients are derived ensuring satisfaction of the operating constraints over the entire time horizon. Furthermore, an intuitive relaxation is proposed to tackle conservatism and a supporting software package is released.

  abstract = {In the kinematic realm, wheeled robot's determining characteristic lies in its nonholonomic constraint. Indeed, the wheels of the robot unequivocally force the robot vehicle to move tangentially to its main axis. Here we test the hypothesis that human locomotion can also be partly described by such a nonholonomic system. This hypothesis is inspired by the trivial observation that humans do not walk sideways: some constraints of different natures (anatomical, mechanical\ldots) may restrict the way humans generate locomotor trajectories. To model these constraints, we propose a simple differential system satisfying the so called rolling without sliding constraint. We validated the proposed model by comparing simulated trajectories with actual (recorded) trajectories obtained from goal-oriented locomotion of human subjects. These subjects had to start from a pre-defined position and direction in space and cross over to a distant porch so that both initial and final positions and directions were controlled. A comparative analysis was successfully undertaken by making use of numerical methods to compute the control inputs from actual trajectories. To achieve this, three body segments were used as local reference frames: head, pelvis and torso. The best simulations were obtained using the last body segment. We therefore suggest an analogy between the steering wheels and the torso segment, meaning that for the control of locomotion, the trunk behavior is constrained in a nonholonomic manner. Our approach allowed us to successfully predict 87 percent of trajectories recorded in seven subjects and might be particularly relevant for future pluridisciplinary research programs dealing with modeling of biological locomotor behaviors.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of navigating a mobile robot through dense human crowds. We begin by exploring a fundamental impediment to classical motion planning algorithms called the ``freezing robot problem'': once the environment surpasses a certain level of dynamic complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. We argue that this problem can be avoided if the robot anticipates human cooperation, and accordingly we develop interacting Gaussian processes, a prediction density that captures cooperative collision avoidance, and a ``multiple goal'' extension that models the goal-driven nature of human decision making. We validate this model with an empirical study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance. The multiple goal interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities nearing 0.8 humans/m2, while a state-of-the-art non-cooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than three times as often as the multiple goal extension, and twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian process approach. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used dynamic window approach proves insufficient for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2. We also show that our non-cooperative planner or our reactive planner capture the salient characteristics of nearly any dynamic navigation algorithm. Based on these experimental results and theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is critical for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the safe navigation of a mobile robot through crowds of dynamic agents with uncertain trajectories. Existing algorithms suffer from the ``freezing robot'' problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in ``joint collision avoidance'': They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop IGP, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efficiently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, first comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and find that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably.},

The navigation scheme proposed explicitly reasons on the future behavior of the people involved so as to produce better socially acceptable trajectories (not to mention safer trajectories as well).

  abstract = {In the last decades, a large variety of robot motion planners emerged. However, manoeuvring in very narrow environments, e.g., for common parking scenarios, cannot be reliably handled with existing path planners at low computing costs. This is why, this paper presents a fast optimisation based path planner which specialises on narrow environments. In the proposed approach, the kinematic differential equations are discretised. For the resulting discrete path segments, a static optimisation problem is formulated to determine the path independently of the considered scenario. In each iteration step, the path length is also optimised to handle close distances to the obstacles as well as longer driving distances. Due to the local nature heuristic rules for driving direction changes are formulated which intend to imitate the behaviour of a human driver. The drawback of the local nature is the lack of global information to handle scenarios with obstacles blocking the path. To overcome this problem, a tree-based guidance for the local planner is introduced. The landmarks for the tree are implicitly created by the local planner allowing an efficient exploration of the free configuration space. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated utilising Monte-Carlo simulations and compared to state-of-the-art path planning algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of provably safe navigation for a mobile robot with a limited field-of-view placed in a unknown dynamic environment. In such a situation, absolute motion safety (in the sense that no collision will ever take place whatever happens in the environment) is impossible to guarantee in general. It is therefore settled for a weaker level of motion safety dubbed passive motion safety: it guarantees that, if a collision is inevitable, the robot will be at rest. The primary contribution of this paper is a relaxation of the Inevitable Collision State (ICS) concept called Braking ICS. A Braking ICS is a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory of the robot is, it is impossible to stop before a collision takes place. Braking ICS are designed with a passive motion safety perspective for robots with a limited field-of-view in unknown dynamic environments. Braking ICS are formally defined and a number of important properties are established. These properties are then used to design a Braking ICS checker, i.e. an algorithm that checks whether a given state is a Braking ICS or not. In a companion paper, it is shown how the Braking ICS checker can be integrated into a reactive navigation scheme whose passive motion safety is provably guaranteed.},
