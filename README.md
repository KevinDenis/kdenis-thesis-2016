# Semi-Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation in Populated Enviroments

## Main objective of Master Thesis

1. Develop a local path planner based on splines formulated as a constraint optimization problem
2. This path planner should be able to include dynamic obstacle avoidance
3. Take into account tje dynamics of the wheelchair
4. Fast enough so that the user doesn't feel the latency (goal : 5 Hz)
